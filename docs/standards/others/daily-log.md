## Why
The importance of developers maintaining a daily log of their activities lies in its ability to provide a clear record of their work progress and accomplishments. It facilitates project tracking, aids in identifying potential issues or bottlenecks, and promotes effective communication within the team. Additionally, it serves as a valuable reference for performance evaluations and ensures accountability and transparency in the development process.
