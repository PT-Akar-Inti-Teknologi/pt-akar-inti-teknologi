# Technical Impact Analysis Document
{: .no_toc }

## Why
When changes or bugs arise in our system, it is crucial to conduct a thorough Technical Impact Analysis (TIA). A Technical Impact Analysis not only aids in the immediate resolution of issues but also serves as a valuable resource for ongoing improvement and risk mitigation in the development process.

## Structure
- Problem
  
  Identify and define the specific issue or bug that has arisen. This sets the stage for a focused and effective analysis.

- Description

  Provide a detailed description of the problem, including any symptoms or errors observed. This context helps in understanding the severity and nature of the issue.

- Root Problem

  Conduct a thorough analysis to uncover the underlying cause of the problem. Understanding the root problem is essential for developing an effective solution.

- Solution

  Outline the proposed solution to address the root problem. This should include any necessary steps, resources, and timelines for implementation.

- Impact
  
  Assess and document the potential impact of the problem and the proposed solution on the system, users, and other dependent components, whether it is major, medium, or minor.

- Scope
  
  Define the scope of the problem and the solution. This includes identifying which components, modules, or systems are affected and to what extent.

- File Publish

  List any files or documentation that need to be published or updated as part of the solution. Ensuring up-to-date documentation is key for future reference and maintenance.

- Location

  Specify the location of the affected files or systems. This helps in quickly accessing and addressing the problem area.

- Changes

  Document any changes that will be made to the system, including code modifications, configuration updates, or process adjustments. Clear documentation ensures that all stakeholders are aware of the changes and their implications.

- Lesson Learned

  Reflect on the entire process to identify what was learned. This includes what worked well, what could be improved, and any recommendations for preventing similar issues in the future.
