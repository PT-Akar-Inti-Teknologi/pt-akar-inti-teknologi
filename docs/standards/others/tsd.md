# Technical Spesification Document
{: .no_toc }

## Why
The importance of a Technical Specification Document (TSD) lies in its ability to serve as a comprehensive blueprint for a project. It provides clear guidelines, outlines technical requirements, and acts as a reference point for the entire development team. The TSD ensures that everyone involved in the project is on the same page, minimizes misunderstandings, and helps maintain consistency and quality throughout the development process.
