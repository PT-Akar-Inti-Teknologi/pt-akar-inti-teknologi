# Repository Description

## Why

Repository name is limited in character (40 characters max in Github), so description (or Project Description in Gitlab) is the best way to explain in brief about the repository while it's still searchable and showing in search results.

## Convention

- It should at least explain the repository name. For example, the description for `ait_jira_report_backend` repository should be "**AIT Jira Report Backend**" at the minimum, this way at least we know what `ait` or `jira_report` stands for.
- It should contains the main technology or framework used. For example, "**AIT Jira Report Backend Using Spring Boot**", this way we can easily search repository based on major framework or technology such as Spring Boot, Laravel, Angular JS, Flutter and so on.
- If necessary put the programming language used to differentiate with other. For example put Kotlin to differentiate with other project using Java, or put Swift to differentiate with other project using Objective C.
